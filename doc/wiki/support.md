Support {#md_support}
=======

If you find simple bugs or lack some feature that you think would be relatively easy for us to add/or resolve, the simplest thing is simply to write to the [forum](https://sourceforge.net/p/acado/discussion/). An alternative would be to add a ticket to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/acado/acado/issues). We are trying to read the forum posts regularly and to respond as soon as possible. When you contact us regarding the bugs/problems, please do the following:

* state the code version: send us output of the command: `git rev-parse HEAD` (this should work in Linux/OS X/Cygwin);
* state the nature of the problem and
* in case you cannot compile the code paste the compiler output .

The only thing we expect for this kind of support is that you cite us, whenever you use the ACADO toolkit in scientific work (look [here](@ref md_features) for more info).

> **NOTE:** Posts and/or emails simply stating "it does not work" with very little explanation will be treated with low priority.

If you want more help, we are always open for **academic** or **industrial cooperation**. An academic cooperation usually takes the form of a co-authorship of a journal paper, and an industrial cooperation involves a negotiated consulting contract. Please contact the us directly via the email [support@acadotoolkit.org](mailto:support@acadotoolkit.org) if you are interested in this.
