{"name":"ACADO Toolkit","tagline":"Toolkit for Automatic Control and Dynamic Optimization","body":"# ACADO Toolkit\r\n## Toolkit for Automatic Control and Dynamic Optimization\r\n\r\nACADO Toolkit is a software environment and algorithm collection for automatic control and dynamic optimization. It provides a general framework for using a great variety of algorithms for direct optimal control, including model predictive control, state and parameter estimation and robust optimization. ACADO Toolkit is implemented as self-contained C++ code and comes along with user-friendly MATLAB interface. The object-oriented design allows for convenient coupling of existing optimization packages and for extending it with user-written optimization routines.\r\n\r\nACADO toolkit is an open-source tool, depending only on the Standard Template Library. The tool is distributed under the [LGPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html) license, meaning the code can be used royalty-free even in commercial applications.\r\n\r\nMore information about the toolkit can be found at the [homepage](http://www.acadotoolkit.org).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
